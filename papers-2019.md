- discrepancy: target domain yields much smaller feature norms compared to source
- existing statistical discrepancy: $\mathcal{H}-divergence$, $\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}-divergence$, MMD, correlation distance
  - RevGrad empirically measure $\mathcal{H}-divergence$ by a parametric domain discriminator
  - MCD reduces  $\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}-divergence$
- contribution: 
  - a statistic distance to calculate mean-feature-norm discrepancy across domains
  - restrict the expected feature norms of the two domains to a shared scalar
  - Stepwise AFN, progressive feature-norm enlargement for each individual sample across domain
- experiments on: Office31, Office-Home, ImageCLEF-DA, VisDA17

[Towards Accurate Model Selection in Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DEV)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/you19a/you19a.pdf) Tsinghua

- **Deep Embedded Validation** (DEV) for algorithm comparison: choose the best model for target (on test data)
  - Importance-Weighted Cross-Validation (IWCV): under covariate shift in input space, weighted validation risk $\approx$ target risk given density ratio (**importance weights**), bounded by RÃ©nyi divergence
  - Transfer Cross-Validation (TrCV): require labeled target data
- distribution divergence becomes smaller after feature adaptation
  - better adaptation model $\to$ lower distribution divergence in feature space
  - distribution divergence can be reduced but not eliminated
- **A**: for deep models: $d_{\alpha+1}(q_f, p_f) < d_{\alpha+1}(q, p)$ (true???)
  - $w_f(x)=\frac{q_f(x)}{p_f(x)}$ instead of $w(x)=\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$ $\to$ unbiased estimator of target risk
- **B**: density ratio estimation by domain discriminator: $w_f(x)=\frac{J_f(x|d=0)}{J_f(x|d=1)}=\frac{J_f(d=0)}{J_f(d=1)}\frac{J_f(d=0|x)}{J_f(d=1|x)}$
- **C**: variance reduction by control variates: $z^*=z+\eta (t-\tau)$, $Var(z^*)\le$ $Var(z)$ (from statistics)
- $\mathcal{R}_{DEV}(g)=mean(L)+\eta\times mean(W)-\eta$

[**Transferability vs. Discriminability: Batch Spectral Penalization for Adversarial Domain Adaptation (BSP)](<http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/chen19i/chen19i.pdf>) Tsinghua

- adversarial DA: learn transferable features $\to$ transferability $\uparrow$, discriminability $\downarrow$
- **hypothesis**: largest eigenvectors dominate feature transferability, discriminability depend on more eigenvectors
- Batch Spectral Penalization (BSP): increase feature discriminability  by strengthening the other eigenvectors
  - penalty on the largest eigenvectors: $L(F)=\Sigma^k_{i=1}(\sigma_{s,i}^2+\sigma_{t,i}^2)$
- discriminability: 
  - largest ratio of inter-class variance and intra-class variance in a projected space (Linear Discriminant Analysis)  $argmax_W J(W)=\frac{trW^TS_bW}{tr(W^TS_wW)}$
  - source + target error rate: **obviously** high error rate = low discriminability (jointly trained source and target classifier using target labels) $\to$ worse generalization error bound
  - sharp distribution of singular values **imply** deteriorated discriminability
- transferability: 
  - **ability of feature representations to bridge the discrepancy across domains** (quantitative measure?)
  - principal angles (similarity of 2 subspaces): ???
- DANN: training domain discriminator = maximize statistical distance between P and Q: $dist_{P \leftrightarrow Q}(F, D)$
- **to clarify**: 
  - adversarial DA enhances transferability while reducing discriminability???

  - error in any domain: $\varepsilon_S(h\circ g)+\varepsilon_T(h\circ g)=1, \forall h:\mathbb{R} \mapsto\{0,1\}$
  - $\varepsilon_T(h)\le \varepsilon_S(h)+\frac{1}{2}d_\mathcal{H\Delta H}(\mathcal{D}_S,\mathcal{D}_T)+\lambda ^*+O(\sqrt\frac{d log n+log(1/\delta)}{n})$

  - $d_\tilde{\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{D}_S,\mathcal{D}_T)$: discrepancy between the marginal distributions 
  - $min\{\mathbb{E}_\mathcal{D_S}[|f_S-f_T|],\mathbb{E}_\mathcal{D_T}[|f_S-f_T|]\}$: distance between labeling functions from source and target domains
- information-theoretic lower bound: 
- domain similarity measure: $\mathcal{H}-divergence:$ $d_\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{D'})=sup_{A\in\mathcal{A}_\mathcal{H}}|Pr_\mathcal{D}(A)-Pr_\mathcal{D'}(A)|$
