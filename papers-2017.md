#### [Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization - ICCV17 (AdaIN)](<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06868.pdf>)

Xun Huang, Cornell

- **Problem to solve**: arbitrary style transfer
- **Key ideas**: adaptive instance normalization that aligns the mean and variance between content features and style features, channel-wise
- **Main claimed contribution**:
- **Related fields**: 
- **Mathematical formulation**: $AdaIN(x,y)=\sigma(y)(\frac{x=\mu(x)}{\sigma(x)})+\mu(y)$
- **Experiments on**:
- **Benchmark with**:
- **Implementation**: []()
- **Implementation details**: 
- **Similar/precedent papers**: 
- **To clarify**:
- **To improve**:
- **Remarks**: IN: computed across spatial dimensions independently for each channel and each sample $\mu_{nc}(x)=\frac{1}{HW}\Sigma_{h=1}^H\Sigma_{w=1}^Wx_{nchw}$, calculated for each sample whether train or test
